Its a open CV project done by me,with a simple machine learning stuff,that for trying to find a solution to solve a sudoku puzzle automatically,

Convolutional Neural Network is its intelligence.....

this was the libraries i used here:
import cv2
import os
import numpy as np

it is portable and supported by all version,some conflicts are to be fixed as soon,but its working properly some how...

as image processing the thresholding function is used.
Gaussian Blur truncates
Dilating the image to fill up the "cracks" in lines are getting delay to extract
Eroding is under building
